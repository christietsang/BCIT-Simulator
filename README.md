**Notes**
Unit tests for battle_gameplay tests that the value "None" is returned.  If that specific patch 
is commented out, the print statements in the targeted helper function will run.  This is the 
method I have used to demonstrate that the right functions are being run in the function.

The boss is located at coordinates (20, 21).
